Introduction

My biggest inspiration for the latest iteration of my portfolio was actually the recent Instagram style update. The gradients, the rounded buttons and clean white spaces with a dark grey font.

The other major considerations were that I wanted to design the entire website mobile first so that it had a fluid scalability going on varying resolutions. To do that I followed <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Web Design Methodology</a> which allowed me a great amount of flexibility when re-arranging my website for different resolutions/break-points.

Initially proto-typed on paper I organised the user journey through a usability flow chart. This included exploring; how I wanted the direct mobile resolutions to animate and work, which features I wanted to move around using Atomic design whilst keeping in mind I would keep it all in a 960px grid.

Once I had planned it on paper I began to prototype a low fidelity wireframe on Balsamiq. I then produced a higher fidelity wireframe on Sketch. After making changes based off the wireframes and feedback I produced the website in Atom.

Though I love Bootstrap I wanted to try a few new frameworks in this version of my portfolio. So I enlisted the aid of <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">Animated.css</a>, <a href="http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/">WoW.js</a> and <a href="http://fontawesome.io/icons/">Font-awesome Icons</a>.

I felt overall it turned out quite well. It became responsive and scalable just as a I wanted. I think after this project I'll certainly be more confident in producing non-bootstrap responsive websites. The next version of this portfolio will be designed fully in SASS, Angular.js and Flexbox.
